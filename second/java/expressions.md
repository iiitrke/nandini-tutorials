## Expressions
An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value. You've already seen examples of expressions, illustrated in bold below:

    int cadence = 0;
    anArray[0] = 100;
    System.out.println("Element 1 at index 0: " + anArray[0]);

    int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
    if (value1 == value2) 
    System.out.println("value1 == value2");
